# **Mobile Payment Systems**
**Line Pay**
Line Pay is a payment system similar to Apple pay which operates inside the LINE messaging application offering contactless payment solutions via a mobile barcode that is scanned by the cashier and then the payment is authorized to your credit card. However, it currently does not support Visa/Mastercard/JCB of all countries and is quite limited in functionality for those who are not citizens or residents and do not have a Line Pay Visa Debit/Credit card from CTCB Bank. 

**Apple Pay**
Apple pay is currently operational in Taiwan and a list of locations which accept Apple pay can be found at the following link. Please note however, although Apple Pay is accepted at Familymart at the current time, it is limited to only Taixin Bank Card holders, and not "open" for use by any credit card until July of 2017.

**Samsung Pay**
**Android Pay**

# **Transit Cards (您有卡/一通）**
The two cards in use by transit systems in Taiwan are called Easycard and iPass. These transit cards are reloadable via the terminals inside the train stations, or just by reloading at any convience store islandwide. Not only can they be used to fund transiting on the MRT, but also the TRA and anything you wish to purchase at convenience stores nationwide. They both offer their own application for tracking purchases made and transit amounts deducted, as well as checking the current amount on the card. The downside is that there is a signficant delay with when you actually made the purchase or transit trip, and when the amount is reflected via App, usually 3 days. If you need to check the amount remaining on your card right away, you can just either ask staff at 7, Familymart, or OK mart to check your current balance, or use the iBon/Familyport terminals in the stores. As well obviously the IC card readers are located on the terminal machines inside any MRT/TRA station. As of this year, iPass is accepted anywhere Easycard is also accepted. The maxinum reloadable amount for both cards is 10,000NTD.

Please note one cannot simply just refund Easycards anymore and the refund process is lengthy, and refund will be mailed to your residence. If your not a resident here it's probably more worth your while to keep your card as a keepsake and not bother with the 4.00 refund. Pay careful attention not to lose your Easycard as those that are not registered will not be able to be re-imbursed if they are lost/stolen. Those who are issued credit cards or debit cards from their bank with dual Easycard/iPass functionality will automatically be registered and insured the value if you are to lose your card and replace with a new one.

# **Disaster Awareness/Response**

**Earthquakes:** Taiwan experiences frequent minor Earthquakes, while not up to par with the Early Warning System that operates in Japan, Taiwan does make use of technology to keep citizens alert if an emergency were to occur. There is not much you actually have to do in order to setup any device to be aware of Earthquake or other disaster alerts. Devices manufactured within the last 5 year period should include a form of emergency and government alerts without any setup, just connecting to Taiwan's cellular network will push notifications (*in Chinese only*, although you can grasp the point from the earthquake magnitude reading) to your device if and when an sizeable earthquake or other natural disaster does occur. As always it's better to be over-prepared then underprepared so here are some additional links to applications the government has developed, as well as where to check online about recent quakes.
