**Earthquakes:** Taiwan experiences frequent minor Earthquakes, while not up to par with the Early Warning System that operates in Japan, Taiwan does make use of technology to keep citizens alert if an emergency were to occur. There is not much you actually have to do in order to setup any device to be aware of Earthquake or other disaster alerts. Devices manufactured within the last 5 year period should include a form of emergency and government alerts without any setup, just connecting to Taiwan's cellular network witll push notifications to your device if and when an sizeable earthquake or other natural disaster does occur. As always it's better to be over-prepared then underprepared so here are some additional links to applications the government has developed, as well as where to check online about recent quakes.
