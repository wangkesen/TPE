# **Mobile Payment Systems**
**Line Pay**
Line Pay is a payment system similar to Apple pay which operates inside the LINE messaging application offering contactless payment solutions via a mobile barcode that is scanned by the cashier and then the payment is authorized to your credit card. However, it currently does not support Visa/Mastercard/JCB of all countries and is quite limited in functionality for those who are not citizens or residents and do not have a Line Pay Visa Debit/Credit card from CTCB Bank. 

**Apple Pay**
Apple pay is currently operational in Taiwan and a list of locations which accept Apple pay can be found at the following link. Please note however, although Apple Pay is accepted at Familymart at the current time, it is limited to only Taixin Bank Card holders, and not "open" for use by any credit card until July of 2017.

**Samsung Pay**
**Android Pay**

# **Disaster Awareness/Response**

**Earthquakes:** Taiwan experiences frequent minor Earthquakes, while not up to par with the Early Warning System that operates in Japan, Taiwan does make use of technology to keep citizens alert if an emergency were to occur. There is not much you actually have to do in order to setup any device to be aware of Earthquake or other disaster alerts. Devices manufactured within the last 5 year period should include a form of emergency and government alerts without any setup, just connecting to Taiwan's cellular network will push notifications (*in Chinese only*, although you can grasp the point from the earthquake magnitude reading) to your device if and when an sizeable earthquake or other natural disaster does occur. As always it's better to be over-prepared then underprepared so here are some additional links to applications the government has developed, as well as where to check online about recent quakes.
